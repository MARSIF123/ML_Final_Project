Classification Using KNN and SVM - ML 25
Project Overview

This project implements two supervised learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify iris flowers into three species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica) based on measurements of sepals and petals.

The project demonstrates loading data, preprocessing, training models, saving/loading models, evaluating performance, and comparing results.

Requirements

Python >= 3.8

Libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
pickle



Install required packages using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Setup & Run Instructions
1. Clone or Upload Project: Clone the entire ML_Final_Project folder to your local machine or upload to Google Colab environment.

2. Run the Project Using main.py: python src/main.py

3. Check Results: Accuracy of models will be printed in the console/output. First 10 predictions will also be displayed. Trained models are saved in the result/ folder as .pkl files
